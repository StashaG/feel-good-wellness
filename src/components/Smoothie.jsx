                <p>Adults need anywhere from 7-13 cups of produce daily to get all the health 
                    benefits of fruits and vegetables -- including possible protection against 
                    obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. "Fruits and veggies can 
                    help prevent your risk of heart disease." One of the many reasons eating enough 
                    vegetables and fruits is important is because they provide the fiber that's needed 
                    to keep your digestive system functioning properly. Going long periods without eating 
                    them may result in a weaker digestive system that causes stomach aches and discomfort. 
                    While fruits and veggies are filling, they are naturally low in calories, which makes 
                    them essential for adults trying to maintain their body weight. The fact that they help 
                    people keep their weight down and ensure they have a healthy digestive system is just one 
                    aspect that helps avoid serious diseases. The vitamins and minerals that fruits and vegetables 
                    provide also reduce your risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and even some forms of cancer. 
                    They're also vital to ensuring you stay energized throughout the day.</p>
